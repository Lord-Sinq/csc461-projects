## Project 2 - Museum

In this museum you'll find the 10 prominent celestial bodies that grace our solar system. We chose the solar system due to a mutual fascination with the subject. To get some information about the exhibits, approach the pedestals they rest and some text will appear.

BONUSES:

1) There are 10 exhibits, each with a reactive element.
2) Each exhibit is animated to spin.
